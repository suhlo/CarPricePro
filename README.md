# Car Price Prediction 🚗

## Overview
This project predicts the price of a car using Machine Learning. It looks at features like brand, engine size, horsepower and fuel type. The goal is to help people understand a fair price for a car in a simple and clear way.

## What This Project Does
The project is divided into three steps:

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Fixed spelling mistakes in car brand names.
- Standardized all brand labels.
- Removed unnecessary columns like ID.
- Prepared the data for analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis
- Explored the data to find which features affect price the most.
- Found that horsepower, curb weight and brand are the strongest indicators.
- Created charts to show the patterns.

### 3. Machine Learning Models
Two models were trained and compared:
- **Linear Regression** – simple and easy to understand.
- **Random Forest** – handles complex price patterns well.

**Result:**  
Random Forest performed the best and gave more accurate predictions.

## Key Factors That Affect Car Price
1. Horsepower  
2. Curb Weight  
3. Brand Name  

These features had the highest influence on the final predicted price.
